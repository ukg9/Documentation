Monitoring is based on JSON payloads generated during onboarding, which contain InstantID verification results. These files are stored in a secure data repository and parsed to extract key fields such as ApplicationID, ApplicationDate, VerificationScore (CVI), FinalModelResult, FinalDecisionCode, Segment, ChannelCode, and OverrideIndicator.

If available, external fraud outcome data is joined using ApplicationID to support fraud-related metrics. Basic data quality checks—such as completeness, duplication, and format validation—are applied during ingestion to ensure reliability for monitoring.
