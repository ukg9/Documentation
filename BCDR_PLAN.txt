Disaster Recovery Plan

The Alipay fraud detection model operates within Alipay’s broader fraud risk management framework. The vendor has not disclosed specific details regarding the Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) due to proprietary concerns. However, as a financial technology provider, Alipay is positioned to implement IT system recovery measures designed to restore fraud detection services in the event of system failures, cyber incidents, or data corruption. Industry standards for disaster recovery in financial services generally include data backup strategies, failover mechanisms, and predefined recovery time objectives (RTOs) to minimize downtime and resume fraud detection operations efficiently. 
Regulatory guidelines such as the FFIEC IT Examination Handbook, ISO 22301 Business Continuity Management Systems, and Basel Committee’s Principles for Operational Resilience establish clear expectations for disaster recovery in financial services.
Since no official documentation has been provided by the vendor, this report does not contain further information on disaster recovery protocols specific to the fraud detection model.


Business Continuity Plan

The vendor has not disclosed specific details regarding the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) due to proprietary concerns. As part of Alipay’s fraud risk management operations, maintaining continuous fraud prevention capabilities is fundamental to ensuring operational resilience. Business continuity in financial fraud detection systems is typically supported by infrastructure redundancy, alternate fraud monitoring arrangements, and emergency communication plans that help mitigate disruptions. The extent to which these measures apply to the Alipay fraud detection model depends on the vendor’s internal risk management policies and system architecture. 
Regulatory frameworks such as the FFIEC Business Continuity Planning Handbook and the Basel Committee’s Operational Risk Framework outline principles for operational resilience in financial services. Standard industry practices involve defining system uptime expectations, incident response procedures, and communication protocols in case of service disruptions.
In the absence of vendor-provided documentation, this report does not include specific business continuity strategies or policies related to the fraud detection model.
